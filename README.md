# Resources
Two complementary resources are must-to-study resources for me. I studied them repeatedly to grasp the concept entirely. I strongly suggest them to anyone interested in learning computational biology.

# Environment


# Package management
There are several package managers such as pip, homebrew, apt-get, CRAN, CPAN and Bioconductor. [Conda](https://bioconda.github.io/tutorials/gcb2020.html#what-exactly-is-conda) is a combination of other package managers. [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html) is a channel for bioinformatics tools found in conda. [Biopython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Packages) can be installed via conda.
